### Summary
- lack of study on the effect of multiple attribute on individual decision
making. How much more likely is tie formation when there are multiple attributes?
- analysis on multiple friendship networks indicate that main effects of
homophily is positive but interaction effects is negative.
- there seems to be a diminishing returns of being similar in multiple dimensions.
- positive interaction effects imply that people seek individuals who are similar
in multiple dimensions; This would amplify clustering. Negative interaction effects
suggest that social contacts are similar but not in all ways; allows heterogeneous
groups to form
- example: having the same sex and being of the same ethnicity makes tie formation
less likely than the combination of the main effects because interaction effect is
negative.
- models on multidimensional dimensionsal homophily simply look at the total similarity:
number of matches, average similarity etc and assume that the attributes are independent.
This contradicts empirical evidence that shows statistically significant negative interaction effects.
- negative interaction effect explanation: ties between individuals who are very similar
might be less "useful" as they would share the same ideas and sources of information; individuals are similar to neighbors in different ways. Counter-explanation: greater similarity leads to stronger bonds.
- example: when children play soccer, similarity on other dimensions become less important. The primary attribute is "plays_soccer". Similarly, papers cited need not or cannot always be similar in all dimensions. References to papers explain different parts/roles/attributes of the paper. Example: cite CS papers for attributed models, PHY papers for RW models, Sociology papers for motivation etc.
- From this perspective, one dimension at a time can be sufficient to explain tie formation. One could expect decreasing returns on multiple dimensions.
- Data analysis using stochastic actor-oriented models (SOAMs): statistically significant main effects: gender and social status (inferred from pocket money). All attributes
are homophilic. negative interaction effects: gender-ethnicity, gender important when social status is different
- does one dimension take primacy over others in tie formation? does one homophily effect mitigate the effect of other attributes? neg. interaction effects
suggestive of diminishing returns. Conjecture: consider similarity on one dimension. if no similar, consider similar on another dimension (sequential).
- structural proximity is important - effect of triadic closure is positive and significant (effect magnitude as much as main effect of important attributes such as gender).
- proposed explanation of findings: possible upper limit of how beneficial similarity is in tie formation. On the other hand, social relationships are "useful" when relationships
provide access to different set of individuals with different thoughts/ideas/knowledge (Granovetter). Second explanation: not all attributes are important. Some are very important
others are not.
