    "- why is it relevant? The (stochastic) kronecker model is fit to the network data using a likelihood formulation. This means that each node in the kronecker graph needs to correspond to a node in the network data; nodes in the 2 graphs need to be matched in order to maxmimize likelihood. The method described in the paper maximizes the expected likelihood by averaging the likelihood wrt mappings sampled using a metropolis sampler\n",
    "- one alternative method would be to use scalable graph matching algorithms to find the optimal matching; applicable to any graph generated that can be optimized using likelihood formulation.\n",
